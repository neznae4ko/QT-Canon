Add a file menu that allows user to edit config file to change location of tools (ffmpeg, gphoto)
Add camera detection after app is started in Windows
Build and test on Mac OSX
Test and confirm delete photo functionality works correctly on both Windows and Linux
Maybe ditch the Canon SDK on Windows and just go with gphoto
